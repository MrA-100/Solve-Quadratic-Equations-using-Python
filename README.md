# Solve Quadratic Equations using Python
A Python script where you can find the roots of Quadratic equation and even tell their nature (Real or Complex)

### HELP: For roots of the equation which are not Rational numbers, the answer comes in decimals which are very long. Is there a way to show them in the fraction form itself.
